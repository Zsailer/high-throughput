# High-throughput sequencing experiment simulation

This package includes modules that allow a user to simulate HT sequencing experiments and run all analysis.

The package includes:

- Module to build fitnesses, including common distribution functions used in evolutionary biology.
- Module that runs each step in the HT simulation separately and together.
- Module with tools to analyze the output from HT simulation.
